About This Gallery
------------------

This gallery was generated using the PyHC Gallery Automation System, which:

* Automatically scrapes code examples from PyHC package documentation
* Uses LLM processing to improve code quality and formatting
* Generates Sphinx-Gallery compatible examples
* Maintains up-to-date content as packages evolve

The automation system supports multiple documentation formats:

* **Sphinx-Gallery** (e.g., SunPy)
* **nbsphinx** (e.g., PlasmaPy) 
* **Standard Sphinx** (e.g., SpacePy, pysat)

Examples are automatically categorized and include dependency information,
source links, and quality confidence scores.
